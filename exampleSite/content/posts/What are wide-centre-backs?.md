The teaser trailer that Sports Interactive recently released introduced us to one very cool new addition to the Football Manager series; The Wide Centre-Back.

Let's delve into what makes this new FM22 Player Role unique and let's explore how it can revolutionise your tactics and take your team to the next level.

## What does a Wide Centre-Back do?

When we think about the wide centre-back in FM22, what we envision is someone like Kyle Walker playing in a back three for Pep Guardiola. The way I imagine the role will function will be a cross between a box-to-box midfielder and a ball-playing defender.

This is the official description from Sports Interactive:

> The main job of the Wide Centre-Back is to stop the opposing attackers from playing and to clear the ball from danger when required. However, unlike standard central defenders, the Wide Centre-Back is encouraged to stay wide in possession and support the midfield more like a fullback.
